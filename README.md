## [TaxoGen：Constructing Topical Concept Taxonomy by Adaptive](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c420/af96a6725414b7c631757503ed6ac61020e6.pdf)
### Contributions
1. An adaptive spherical clustering module for allocating terms to proper levels when splitting a coarse topic into fine-grained ones.
2. A local embedding module for learning term embeddings that maintain strong discriminative power at different levels of the taxonomy. 

### Methods
**1. Adaptive Spherical Clustering**
* Identify general terms and refine the sub-topics and push general terms back to the parent.
* Using TF-IDF to generate representativeness terms, because  representativeness term should appear frequently in topic S but not in the sibling of topic S.

**2. Local Embedding**
* Using Skip-Gram to learn word embedding。
* Retrieve sub-corpus for topic.

### Datasets
1. DBLP(Contains 600 thousand computer science paper titles)
2. SP(Contains 91 thousand paper abstracts)

## [Learning Semantic Hierarchies via Word Embeddings](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~jguo/papers/acl2014-hypernym.pdf)
### Contributions
This paper proposes a novel method for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings, which are trained using a large-scale corpus.

### Methods
**1. Learning a linear projection which maps words to their hypernyms**
